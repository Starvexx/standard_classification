The source files in this directory are used to estimate interstellar
extinction of the YSO list. However, the PNICER method is only truly
informative for sources without significant infrared excess. For class
II YSOs it is recommended to deredden the sources to the T-Tauri locus,
or use the spectral type to determine the intrinsic color of the source
if a spectral type is available.
