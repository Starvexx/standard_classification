The script in this directory is just a helper script to select sources
with significant infrared excess. This is a necessary step for the
alpha index calculation when using PNICER interstellar extinction
estimation.

This can be ignored for all use cases that do not make use of PNICER or
any of its related extinction estimation codes.
